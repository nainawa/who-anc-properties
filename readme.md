# WHO ANC Properties

A tool written in Python to help developers translate WHO ANC (Antenatal Care) mobile application easier.

## Brief

WHO ANC mobile application is using `.properties` files to handle translation. This helps developers around the world to localize the app and implement antenatal care procedures suggested by the World Health Organization. But, managing thousands of strings and multiple languages is a daunting work.

This tool help translating `.properties` files more seamless by converting it to CSV files first so we can use spreadsheet editor such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet, then generate `.properties` files for multiple languages automatically.
